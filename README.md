# Speech-Recognitionbased-on-ROS-middleware-for-Mobile-Robots

Voice speech is a natural manner in which people communicate with mobile robots. First, the speaker normally sends the right voice commands to handle and monitor moving mobile robots. Secondly, a mobile robot with speaking abilities will communicate with people, to reply to the individual or report him for accurate or misconceptions and the execution of commands from human voice. A suitable automated speech model is the popular way to achieve voice communications between individuals and mobile robots. In this study we will discuss about voice recognition and the ability of the system to receive, interpret, analyze, and carry out the spoken commands. Also, implementation of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and perform the simulation in ROS middleware, then creating a GUI and executing Voice control mobile robot package in ROS. Furthermore, this paper also discusses our experimental result.
